# BVM Interâ€‘College Events Ticketing System

Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS 4, modular implementation of the POC page with registration, ticket generation, and Firebase-ready persistence.

## Features

- Public landing with events and FAQ
- Registration modal and a ticket drawer with QR code and PNG download
- Server action + API route ready to persist to Firestore (optional)
- Admin dashboard scaffold

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Optional: Configure Firebase by setting the following env vars (e.g., in `.env.local`):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
```

With env configured, server action/API will persist registrations in `registrations` collection.

## Notes

- No participant accounts required. Consider securing `/admin` via Firebase Auth + middleware.
- The ticket is stored in localStorage for quick access; persistence is through Firestore when configured.
  This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
